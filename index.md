what:
  title: What is GOAT?
  image: heatmap.png
  description: GOAT stands for Geo Open Accessibility Tool. This web-tool is meant to be open source, interactive, flexible and useful for accessibility planning. It is under development at the [Chair for Urban Structure and Transport Planning at TUM](https://www.bgu.tum.de/sv/startseite/). Currently, GOAT is designed to model walking accessibility, however frequent enhancements and extensions will be made on a regular basis. At the moment you can test the demo version of GOAT for the city of Munich [here](https://goat.open-accessibility.org/).

why:
  title: Why to use GOAT?
  image: isochrone_amenities.png
  description: There is rising awareness that active mobility plays a vital role in urban transport systems. However, to the date there are few planning instruments that are focusing on walking and cycling. GOAT as an accessibility tool is therefore designed to model walking/cycling accessibility and serve as a suitable instrument for easier, better and more open transport and urban planning.

features:
  title: What are the main features?
  image: draw_bridge.png
  description: The main focus of GOAT is to offer dynamic accessibility analysis at the neighborhood level. At the moment, only the walking mode is supported but soon cycling will follow. With GOAT, you can calculate different accessibility indicators such as isochrones and gravity-based heat-maps. What is more special about GOAT is that you can develop your own case scenarios, for instance you can model a new bridge over a river, and examine corresponding changes in accessibility. You can view GOAT in action in the videos [here](https://www.open-accessibility.org/videos).
