#### Description of the feature
GOAT enables the calculation of multi-isochrones, which show how many residents from a certain neighbourhood have access to a facility (e.g. supermarket, kindergarten, public transport stop) in a certain travel time.

#### Possible use cases
Multi-isochrones can be used to answer different planning questions, some examples can be given:
- How well are the supermarkets currently distributed over the city? In which districts can accessibility deficits be found?
- How many inhabitants can reach a public transport stop by bicycle in a given travel time?


#### Step-by-step tutorial for a exemplary planning task
##### 1 Accessibility to supermarkets
###### 1.1 Planning question
How well are the supermarkets currently distributed over the city? In which districts can accessibility deficits be found?


###### 1.2 Work steps
1. Display the supermarkets as thematic data.

2. Switch to the "Multiple" isochrone calculation mode and select the "Study Area" method, which later lists all results differentiated by districts. Then select all districts that you want to include in the calculation by mouse click in the map.

3. Click on "Calculate".

4. The resulting multi-isochrones shows the catchment areas of the supermarkets (here for the mode "pedestrian" with 5 minutes catchment area in light green and 10 minutes catchment area in dark green). The corresponding table shows, sorted by district, how many people out of the total population can reach a supermarket in 5 or 10 minutes walking distance.
