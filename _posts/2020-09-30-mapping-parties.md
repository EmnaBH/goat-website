The Chair of Urban Structure and Transport Planning is frequently organizing Mapping Parties with the motivation to actively improve the quality of OpenStreetMap (OSM), which is the most prominent example of an open, crowd-sourced geographic dataset.

The OSM-data is widely used by planners, geographers, and developers, for different purposes. However, little contributions are seen by these groups to the OSM-project, mostly because of lack of knowledge how easy it is to contribute.We want to change that and encourage users, who have not contributed to OSM before, to become part of this vibrant community. Thanks to simple mobile apps and web tools everybody can easily contribute without prior knowledge to OSM.

The Mapping Parties always start with a short general introduction into OpenStreetMap and the apps and tool used  for the mapping process. This was followed by assigning the participants to different groups and mapping areas. The mapping contest takes place in different parts of the city and runs for about two hours. Afterwards, we had a get-together where the contributions are quantified and the winners announced. 

In previous years, this took place in person, in beautiful places like the English Garden.

Even this year is not an exception, we organized a very successful Mapping Party on the 24th of September. Due to the current pandemic regulations, we mapped remotely from home, extracting the relevant information from aerial images and Mapillary pictures, or in small groups of 2-3 people mapping in the field via smartphone apps such as GO MAP!! and STREETCOMPLETE. The introduction and get-together took place via zoom.

Over 25 participants from different organizations, such asTechnical University of Munich, Technical University Bergakademie Freiberg, MunichWays and the OSM-Community were part of this event. Together we  edited over 1,000 objects (e.g. cycleways, Points-of-Interest, buildings) and 1,700 attributes in 2 hours of mapping. As the focus on this Mapping Party was to improve the data of the cycleways and Points-of-Interests, ‘surface’, ‘opening_hours’ and ‘segregated’ were some of the mostly mapped attributes.
