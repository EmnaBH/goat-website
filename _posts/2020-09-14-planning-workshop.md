In the last year, the open-source tool GOAT has been experiencing continuous development within the support of the research initiative [mFund](https://www.bmvi.de/DE/Themen/Digitales/mFund/Ueberblick/ueberblick.html). The main goal of this project is to test GOAT in planning practice to improve its usability and usefulness and to consistently adapt the tool to the needs of planners. The project started with a series of [test cycles in the municipality of Fürstenfeldbruck](https://www.open-accessibility.org/testcycles/), which was followed by planning workshops in Fürstenfeldbruck, Freising, and an internal workshop at the TUM, and will end with a planning workshop with the city of Munich in October and a synthesis workshop in November.

The three planning workshops were conducted in the municipalities of Fürstenfeldbruck and Freising and at the Chair of Urban Structure and Transport Planning (TUM). Experts from different backgrounds such as city planners, transport planners, architects, and politicians participated in these workshops and contributed to the further development of GOAT.

All three planning workshops were conducted according to the same agenda. First, the GOAT team and the participants introduced themselves briefly. This was followed by an introduction to GOAT and its main features for those who were not familiar with the tool before. The project team then presented the planning questions that had been prepared for the local context in consultation with the local planners to the participants, who could then choose which question they wanted to tackle based on their interests. The participants worked on the planning questions in small groups and presented their results at the end of the workshop.

The planning questions were based on real planning tasks from each municipality. Among them:
- <b>New development areas</b>: Scenario for new residential development with local supply (e.g. kindergarten, supermarket) and additional path connections
- <b>New pedestrian and bicycle bridges</b>: Scenario development for new bridges and comparison of the accessibility effects of different locations
- <b>Barrier-free reconstruction of a pedestrian bridge</b>: Development of scenarios for the barrier-free reconstruction of a pedestrian bridge and performance of analysis of the resulting effects on wheelchair accessibility 
- <b>Location planning for local supply</b> (e.g. supermarket) and <b>mobility services</b> (e.g. Bikesharing and Mobility stations): Comparison of different locations through accessibility analyzes with heat maps and multi-isochrones 

The following illustration shows, based on an exemplary planning question about the densification of a village close to Freising, how the planning questions were processed during the workshops and how GOAT can be used to answer common questions in urban and transport planning:

While processing the planning questions and during the feedback round, the participants suggested many good ideas for improvements, for example:
- Integration of further data (aircraft noise map, trees)
- Insert a size reference for drawing new buildings
- Enable to name scenarios and add the possibility to switch different scenarios on and off 
- Provide the option to edit existing streets and change their attributes
- Enable to model the influence of construction sites (e.g. temporary road closures) on accessibility
- Provide the possibility to export the heatmap
- Make it simpler to compare the isochrones of different modes


The suggestions for improvements were documented and will be, wherever possible, implemented in the further development process - some of the features are even already in development and will be released soon. These planning workshops will be followed by a final synthesis workshop with participants from all municipalities and further experts, where the experiences will be discussed and final suggestions defined.
