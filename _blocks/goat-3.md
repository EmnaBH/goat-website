The main focus of GOAT is to offer dynamic accessibility analysis at the neighborhood level. At the moment, only the walking mode is supported but soon cycling will follow. With GOAT, you can calculate different accessibility indicators such as isochrones and gravity-based heat-maps. What is more special about GOAT is that you can develop your own case scenarios, for instance you can model a new bridge over a river, and examine corresponding changes in accessibility. You can view GOAT in action in the videos [here](https://www.open-accessibility.org/videos).
