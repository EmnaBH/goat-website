GOAT stands for Geo Open Accessibility Tool. This web-tool is meant to be open source, interactive, flexible and useful for accessibility planning. It is under development at the [Chair for Urban Structure and Transport Planning at TUM](https://www.bgu.tum.de/sv/startseite/). Currently, GOAT is designed to model walking accessibility, however frequent enhancements and extensions will be made on a regular basis. At the moment you can test the demo version of GOAT for the city of Munich [here](https://goat.open-accessibility.org/).
