We love OPEN SOURCE! It is the heart and soul of GOAT since our foundation. For that reason, GOAT’s architecture is completely built with open source software, anyone can contribute and the operation and functionality of GOAT is completely free. Therefore, GOAT is built with OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, their geographical data is the most complete in the world, and that is thanks to the thousands of mappers and contributors around the globe. Like a lot of those contributors, we are local mappers that aim to improve the quality of the data in our neighborhoods and mainly the areas were currently GOAT is available. Therefore, we have developed a new way to improve the data used by GOAT right from the platform, this feature is called OSM Mapping Mode.

With this new feature, we are introducing a way to edit OSM-data without leaving GOAT. Moreover, we are looking to focus and make easier the improvement of the data required by the features of GOAT. How does it work? The topics and data required to be completed are organized as tasks. Right now, there are tasks available for completing the information about building types, the maximum speed and the quality of the surface in the streets, as well as the opening hours of points of interest. In the images below you can see how the mapping challenges in GOAT look like. To know more about how you can contribute to the operation of GOAT through this tool please check out our TUTORIAL (LINK).

You are highly welcome to test the OSM Mapping Mode in the GOAT versions of Munich, Fürstenfeldbruck and Freising. In Fürstenfeldbruck and Freising, we additionally created mapping challenges in a tool called MapRoulette. The system works very similarly by setting tasks related to the information that we want to improve, so far, we have set three [tasks](https://maproulette.org/browse/challenges?project=GOAT) in MapRoulette. Two for Freising and one for Fürstenfeldbruck, related to the update of opening hours of POIs (see image below).

We thank you for your interest in improving the OSM-data. OSM is the best source of the geographical information and it has been like that thanks to thousands of people that work on its collection and keeping the data up to date. Improving the information available for everybody is part of our DNA, by developing OSM Map Mode and using MapRoulette we are committed to improving the info available in our local context. With a better quality of the data available, we can enhance the operation and results of our tool. In the end, that will result in better decisions for those who trust in our work.
