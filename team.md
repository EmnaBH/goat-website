On this page, we would like to introduce the people behind GOAT. We are a diverse team of Environmental Engineers, GIS Developers and Transport Planners. As GOAT is under development at the [Chair or Urban Structure and Transport Planning at Technical University of Munich](https://www.bgu.tum.de/en/sv/homepage/) led by [Prof. Dr.-Ing. Gebhard Wulfhorst](https://www.bgu.tum.de/en/sv/team/prof-dr-ing-gebhard-wulfhorst/), also most members of the GOAT Team are located at this Chair. With the [Research Group Accessibility Planning](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tum-accessibility-planning) managed by [Dr.-Ing. Benjamin BÃ¼ttner](https://www.bgu.tum.de/en/sv/team/dr-ing-benjamin-buettner/) we aim to support integrated land-use and transport planning by means of accessibility - a concept, which has been proven to enhance the quality of life and sustainability in our cities.
