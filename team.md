On this page, we would like to introduce the people behind GOAT. We are a diverse team of Environmental Engineers, GIS Developers and Geographers. As GOAT is under development at the [Chair of Urban Structure and Transport Planning at Technical University of Munich](https://www.bgu.tum.de/en/sv/homepage/) led by [Prof. Dr.-Ing. Gebhard Wulfhorst](mailto:gebhard.wulfhorst@tum.de), also most members of the GOAT Team are located at this Chair. With the [Research Group Accessibility Planning](https://www.bgu.tum.de/sv/research-group-accessibility-planning/) managed by [Dr.-Ing. Benjamin BÃ¼ttner](mailto:benjamin.buettner@tum.de) we aim to support integrated land-use and transport planning by means of accessibility - a concept, which has been proven to enhance the quality of life and sustainability in our cities.
